# Multi-variant machine

Vagrant is able to define and control multiple guest machines per Vagrantfile. This is known as a "multi-machine" environment.

# Provisioning and tests

This exercise utilised vagrant and VirtualBox to make sure the provision file passed all the tests.

#### Installation

##### Pre-requisites:
- install Vagrant
- install VirtualBox
- install Ruby
- install Bundler

To get this box running:
1. clone the repo
2. make sure you are on the root of the project and can see the Vagrant file
3. then run:
```bash
vagrant up
```

Now you can see nginx running on 2 locations:
- ip: 192.168.10.100
- development.local/

To see the website working:
1. cd eng57-multi-vagrant
2. vagrant ssh app
3. cd /home/ubuntu/app
4. sudo npm install
5. sudo npm start

Now you can see the website running here:
- development.local:3000
- development.local:3000/fibonacci/{index}



#### Tests

```bash
cd starter-code/tests
bundle install
rake spec
```


# Jenkins

## Create a CI pipeline
 1. Go to: http://18.130.21.164:8080/
 2. Log in
 3. Configure
    - good practice: delete old builds
    - GitHub project: link to your github repo [i.e. https://github.com/Saskia-vB/eng57-multi-vagrant/]
    - Select Git as version control manager:
        - Repository URL: enter github clone SSH key [i.e. git@github.com:Saskia-vB/eng57-multi-vagrant.git]
        - Credentials: create a SSH Key - follow documentation : https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
    - select "Github hook trigger for GITScm poling"
    - Build environments: select "add Node/npm to path"
    - Build:
    ```bash
    cd app
    npm install
    npm test
    ```
  4. Create a Webhook on Github repo - go to repo > settings > webhooks > add webhook
    - Payload URL: http://18.130.21.164:8080/github-webhook/
    - Content type: application/json
    - select "send me everything"
