# Multi-variant machine

Vagrant is able to define and control multiple guest machines per Vagrantfile. This is known as a "multi-machine" environment.

# Provisioning and tests

This exercise utilised vagrant and VirtualBox to make sure the provision file passed all the tests.

#### Pre-requisites
- Vagrant
- Virtual box
- ruby
- bundler

#### Installation

##### Pre-requisites:
- install Vagrant
- install VirtualBox
- install Ruby
- install Bundler

To get this box running:
1. clone the repo
2. make sure you are on the root of the project and can see the Vagrant file
3. then run:
```bash
vagrant up
```

Now you can see nginx running on 2 locations:
- ip: 192.168.10.100
- development.local/

#### Tests

```bash
cd starter-code/tests
bundle install
rake spec
```
